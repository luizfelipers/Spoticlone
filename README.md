Clone da interface visual do Spotify utilizando HTML, CSS e Bootstrap4

One of my first attempts to UI building using pure HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4 classes.

In this project, all the elements are surrounded by a solid border, in order to reveal how different positioning and rotations of divs behave 'behind the curtains'.
This was built only for study matters and I followed a tutorial by Jamilton Damasceno to get along with it.
